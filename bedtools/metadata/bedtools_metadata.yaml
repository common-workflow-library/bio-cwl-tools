s:about: |
  A software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features
  in browser extensible data (BED) and general feature format (GFF) format.
  BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both
  BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare
  large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom
  genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with
  standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines
  that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.
